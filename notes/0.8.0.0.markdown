gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho 0.8.0.0 resolves major problems found in 0.7.1.2

## Planned scope & Issues resolved:

- [#42 Viewpoint for OML](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/42)

- [#71 Serialization of SingletonInstanceScalarDataPropertyValue not as expected](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/71)

  OML abstract syntax includes several LiteralValue types that encapsulate different categories of values that can be parsed
  via Xtext datatypes and context-free terminals; see: https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/301_grammarlanguage.html#datatype-rules
  
- [#72 Handling of Annotations for Items within Graphs](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/72)

  The OML abstract syntax and OML concrete syntax had to be aligned with respect to the representation of annotations.
  Before, an annotation was a quad: <module, subject, property, value>; each annotation was owned by a module.
  The concrete syntax parser was deriving the subject based on the relative position of an annotation
  before its annotated subject in the textual representation. This violated the Xtext serialization contract:
  https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/303_runtime_concepts.html#serialization
  The fix involves making an OML Element own the annotations that it is the subject of and that,
  in the textual representation, are always serialized before the element itself.
  The fix includes a unit test to verify Xtext serialization contract on a simple example (OMLAnnotationTest3).
