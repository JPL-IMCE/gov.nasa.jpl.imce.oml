gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho 0.8.0.0 resolves major problems found in 0.7.1.2

## Planned scope & Issues resolved:

- [#13 Branch builds fail on travis-ci](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/13)

  Use the `${oml.version}` in the pom configuration avoids having to manually edit the pom file after setting the version.
  
- [#42 Viewpoint for OML](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/42)

- [#71 Serialization of SingletonInstanceScalarDataPropertyValue not as expected](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/71)

  OML abstract syntax includes several LiteralValue types that encapsulate different categories of values that can be parsed
  via Xtext datatypes and context-free terminals; see: https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/301_grammarlanguage.html#datatype-rules
  
- [#72 Handling of Annotations for Items within Graphs](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/72)

  The OML abstract syntax and OML concrete syntax had to be aligned with respect to the representation of annotations.
  Before, an annotation was a quad: <module, subject, property, value>; each annotation was owned by a module.
  The concrete syntax parser was deriving the subject based on the relative position of an annotation
  before its annotated subject in the textual representation. This violated the Xtext serialization contract:
  https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/303_runtime_concepts.html#serialization
  The fix involves making an OML Element own the annotations that it is the subject of and that,
  in the textual representation, are always serialized before the element itself.
  The fix includes a unit test to verify Xtext serialization contract on a simple example (OMLAnnotationTest3).
  
- [#73 OML Plugins / Feature Fails to Install / Update via Eclipse "Install New Software..."](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/73)

  Added all the repositories used in the target definition as additional repositories for the update site.
  
- [#74 Serialization problem for OML annotations](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/74)

- [#75 Simplify eclipse/tycho build](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/75)

  See #76
  
- [#76 Remove the oml runtime](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/76)

  Removed all `oml.runtime` plugins and features
  Removed the `oml.platform.feature`
  Removed the `oml.platform.updatesite`
  Simplified the OML target platform (removed Sirius related features and Scala related features)
  
- [#77 Remove the OML lifting transformation](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.tycho/issues/77)

  Removed `gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.dsl.ui.converters` (from `dsl.ui`)
  Removed UI contributions for the Lifting transformation (in `dsl.ui/plugin.xml`)
  Disabled generating `gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml.dsl.generator.OMLGenerator` (in `dsl/GenerateOML.mwe2` and `dsl/OMLRuntmeModule.xtend`)
  
- [#82 Conversion of String Values for AnnotationPropertyValues Fails](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml/issues/82)

  Added unit tests to verify the annotation property values are properly serialized.
  
- [#83 Publish an OML P2 update site on bintray](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml/issues/83)

- [#86 "No viable alternative at input" for LiteralNumber values that are positive integers](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml/issues/86)

  Refactored OML's metamodel and grammar to use explicitly-defined datatypes to take advantage of Xtext's support for context-sensitive datatype parsing.
  Context-sensitive datatype parsing really requires defining hierarchies of datatypes such that the set of context-free lexical rules that produce compatible
  datatypes can be interpreted as a context-sensitive way of parsing the union of lexical tokens corresponding a hierarchy of datatypes.
   

- [#89 "The Value [X] is Invalid" Error When Parsing PositiveIntegerLiterals](https://github.com/JPL-IMCE/gov.nasa.jpl.imce.oml/issues/89)

  Xtext's datatype value conversion expects a datatype to have a constructor with a single String argument.
  The PositiveIntegerValue datatype was missing such a constructor.
